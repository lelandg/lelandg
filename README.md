## Thanks for checking my profile.

I've been coding since 1978—learned BASIC on my father's TRS-80, then dove deep on a Commodore 64 (one of the first 4000 off the line). Majored in art, minored in music, became an Advanced Software Engineer by teaching myself.

### Currently Working On

🦎 **[Chameleon Labs](https://chameleonlabs.ai)** — Co-founded in Oct 2025. Building AI-powered web applications, back-ends and open-source (via this profile).

🖼️ **[ImageAI](https://github.com/lelandg/ImageAI)** — Python image/video generator supporting multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Stability AI, local models via Ollama). Built entirely with Claude Code CLI. Great example of practical LLM integration.
